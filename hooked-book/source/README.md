Hooked is a manager for [Git hooks][git-hooks]. It is language-agnostic (not built for any specific language or ecosystem), has a low barrier to entry (hooks can be one-liners in a configuration file) and is extensible (most of what Hooked does can be replaced through its configuration).

If you've been convinced and would like to give it a shot, [Getting Started][getting-started] is the place to be.
