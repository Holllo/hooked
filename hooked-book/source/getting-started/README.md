# Getting Started

To see the available ways to install Hooked, see the [Installation](./installation.md) chapter.

The basics of making hooks is explained in [Creating Hooks](./creating-hooks.md).

And if you already have a configuration set up, head to [the Git side of things](./installing-hooks.md) chapter.
